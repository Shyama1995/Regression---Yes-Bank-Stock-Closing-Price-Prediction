# Regression---Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing the Yes Bank's stock price dataset. Yes Bank, a prominent player in the Indian financial sector, has been in the spotlight since 2018 due to a fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. The dataset encompasses monthly stock prices since the bank's inception, including closing, opening, highest, and lowest prices for each month. The primary goal is to predict the stock's closing price for each month.

Objective: The main objective of this project is to predict the monthly closing price of Yes Bank's stock.

To-Do List: To achieve this objective, the project involves the following tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries. Hypothesis Testing: Validating assumptions and testing hypotheses related to the dataset. Data Manipulation and Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Model Implementation: Building and training regression models to predict the stock's closing price. Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Interpretation: Explaining the predictions made by the models using techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Iteration: Iteratively refining the models and strategies based on evaluation results and insights gained from interpretation. Through these steps, the project aims to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts Yes Bank's stock closing prices, contributing valuable insights to the financial domain.
